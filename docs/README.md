## Documentation

**GatOS** is the low-level kernel and systems API backbone developed as the foundation for the **Pawstack framework**, a larger project detailed in the main [README](/README.md). Its primary aim is to be a stable, efficient, and (in the futrure) secure kernel designed for use in embedded systems, developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at the [University of Macedonia](https://www.uom.gr/en/dai).

While GatOS itself is engineered with the goal to be production-ready some day, I recognize the significant lack of accessible, high-quality material for understanding advanced kernel development and systems programming. To help address this, I am documenting my progress and the core concepts behind GatOS in a series of concise writeups.

These articles serve a dual purpose:
1. **To demystify systems programming** for low-level enthusiasts and aspiring developers by providing clear explanations of the inner workings, design choices, and problem-solving strategies involved in building a modern kernel.
2. **To maintain a detailed technical record** of the project's development, allowing me to formally track the rationale behind implementation decisions and the solutions to complex challenges.

This documentation is intended to complement existing resources like the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) by offering a concrete, in-progress perspective on building a systems-level project from the ground up.

### Contributions

The **GatOS codebase is not open to external contributions** as it must remain my original work for academic purposes and is core to the production Gata project.

However, the documentation section **is open to contributions**. If you spot an error, have a suggestion for clarity, or would like to propose an additional explanatory writeup, please feel free to submit a pull request. All contributions will be reviewed to ensure they maintain the quality and tone of the existing documentation.
