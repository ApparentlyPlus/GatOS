## Documentation

**GatOS** is a personal educational operating system project, developed as part of my undergraduate thesis at my [university](https://www.uom.gr/en/dai). Its primary goal is to serve as a learning platform — both for myself and for anyone interested in low-level systems programming, kernel development, and operating system internals.

>[!WARNING]
>**GatOS** is the low-level kernel and systems API backbone for another project called **Gata**, which is detailed in the main project's README. As such, the documentation here refers to the GatOS kernel, not Gata.

While resources for OS development do exist, they’re often scattered, incomplete, or assume prior knowledge that can be hard to acquire. The [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org) is a great starting point, but it doesn’t provide a full roadmap from beginner to someone capable of navigating or understanding production kernels like Linux. GatOS aims to help bridge that gap by offering not only code but clear, concise writeups that explain the design choices, problems encountered, and solutions implemented along the way.

To that end, the **Documentation** section includes a series of writeups detailing my progress, insights, and the rationale behind each step of the system’s design and implementation. These are written with the goal of making kernel development more accessible and demystifying the black box of systems programming.

### Contributions

While the **GatOS codebase itself is not open to external contributions** — as it must remain my original work for academic purposes — **the documentation is open to contributions**. If you'd like to suggest edits, improvements, or even contribute your own writeups, feel free to submit a pull request. All contributions will be reviewed and must be approved before being merged to ensure quality and consistency.
